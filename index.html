          In creating a base on the moon, we will be
          <strong>unlocking a new world of exploration</strong> into space. Not
          only does it open up new scientific and economic avenues, but it also
          will help <em>bring mankind together</em> in a singular effort.

            <p>
              A moon base will provide a refueling station, and a low-gravity
              launch pad, enabling us to <strong>explore our galaxy</strong> at
              a much lower cost.

              ><em>microgravity</em>, surviving away from our own planet, and
              more, all while staying close enough to Earth for easy
              communication and assistance if needed.

            <h3>Familiar, yet different</h3>
            <p>
              The moon is something we all know, but so few have visited, and
              which is totally different from anything we've ever explored
              before.
